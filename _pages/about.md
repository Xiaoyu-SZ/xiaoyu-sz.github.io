I am now a third year Ph.D. student in [THUIR](http://www.thuir.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science (2022) and my minor degree in Psychology (2023) from Tsinghua University.

My major research interests lies in **Recommender System (RS)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)**. Currently, I focus on the following topics: *Explainable Recommendation*, *LLM for Personalization* and *User Modeling*.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:zhxy0925@gmail.com) if you are interested in my research and looking for possible collaborations!
