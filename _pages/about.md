I am now a third year Ph.D. student in [THUIR](http://www.thuir.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science (2022) and my minor degree in Psychology (2023) from Tsinghua University.

My major research interests lies in **Recommender System (RS)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)**. Currently, I focus on the following topics: 
* Explainable Recommendation
* LLM for Personalization
* User Modeling. 

Please feel free to contact [me](zhxy0925@gmail.com) if you are interested in my research and looking for possible collaborations.
